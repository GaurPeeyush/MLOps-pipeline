# What are the Components of MLOps?
Machine Learning Operations have a set amount of core components which they use in order to perform Machine Learning operations. Some of the components are:

Data Mining/input – The necessary data is taken from a database or mined by Data Miners.
Data Preprocessing – The data mined is preprocessed, that is having null/incompatible data removed, rearranging data and so on.
Training the Model – The preprocessed data is split into train and test batches and then fed to the model, training it.
Parameter Tuning – The trained model’s accuracy is determined by running it with the testing batch. With the feedback/accuracy, the model’s parameters are tuned even more for higher accuracy values.
Model Deployment – After satisfactory accuracy has been achieved, the model is then deployed to the cloud and its actions are observed.
Redefining the model parameters – After a set amount of time, the model is again retrained over and over in order to make it susceptible to the data trends.
